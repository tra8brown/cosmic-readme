# Professional README Generator Starter Code
### detailed description here
* This proffessional README generator was created for the purpose of creating README.mds 
* why you used the technologies you used
* This was a little bit challenging for me due to it being a lot of files to work with and navigate, it was intimidating and I felt a little overwhelmed. I ended up getting a little help by cleaning up the files I didn't really need and I felt better about starting and finishing the project. I dont know if I have any future implementations I can think of at the moment with this but I know there is always room for improvement.
